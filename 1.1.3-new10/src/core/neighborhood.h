  \brief This file contains definitions about the TerraME model for complex neteworks: CellularSpace class.
                 A Neighborhood object is a weighted directed graph of cells. It has been implemented as composite of cells.
                 It may be use to model spatial proximity, spatial topological relationships, system conectivity,
                 social contact networks, roads, rivers, etc.
                 Handles: CellularSpace
                 Implementations: CellularSpaceImpl
